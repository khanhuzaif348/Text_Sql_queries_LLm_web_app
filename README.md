Text to SQL Queries: A Streamlit Web App Powered by LLMs

This web application leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform natural language queries into structured SQL queries. It's designed to simplify database interactions, making it accessible to users with varying technical expertise.

Key Features:

Intuitive Interface: A user-friendly Streamlit frontend allows you to input your query in plain English.

Advanced Language Processing: Behind the scenes, an LLM analyzes your query to understand its intent and structure.

SQL Query Generation: The LLM generates accurate SQL queries based on your input, tailored to your specific database schema.

Database Integration: The generated SQL queries are executed against a SQLite database named student.db.


Real-time Results: The app displays the results of the executed queries in a clear and concise format.


How It Works:


User Input: Enter your natural language query into the provided text box.

LLM Processing: The LLM analyzes the query, identifies entities, and determines the desired action (e.g., SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

SQL Query Generation: The LLM constructs a corresponding SQL query based on the parsed information and the database schema.

Database Execution: The generated SQL query is executed against the student.db database.

Result Display: The app presents the results of the query in a user-friendly format.
